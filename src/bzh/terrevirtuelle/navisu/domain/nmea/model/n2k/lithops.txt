Liste des PGN utilis√©es sur Lithops

59904 : As defined by ISO, this message has a data length of 3 bytes with no padding added to complete 
the single frame. The appropriate response to this message is based on the PGN being requested,
 and whether the receiver supports the requestedPGN.

65408 : Proprietary: Depth Quality Factor

65410 : Proprietary: Internal Device Temperature and Supply Voltage 

126992 : The purpose of this PGN is to provide a regular transmission of UTC time and date; 
optionally synchronized to other parameter groups from the same source. : OK

127258 : Message for transmitting variation. The message contains a sequence number to allow 
synchronization of other messages such as Heading or Course over Ground. 
The quality of service and age of service are provided to enable recipients to determine an
appropriate level of service if multiple transmissions exist.

128259 : This parameter group provides a single transmission that describes the motion 
of a vessel.: OK

128267 : Water depth relative to the transducer and offset of the measuring transducer. 
Positive offset numbers provide the distance from the transducer to the waterline. : OK

128275 : This PGN provides the cumulative voyage distance traveled since the last reset. 
The distance is tagged with the time and date of the distance measurement.

129025 : This PGN provides latitude and longitude referenced to WGS84. Being defined as single
frame message, as opposed to other PGNs that include latitude and longitude and are defined as
fast or multi-packet, this PGN lends itself to being transmitted more frequently without 
using up excessive bandwidth on the bus for the benefit of receiving equipment that may 
require rapid position updates.

129026 : This parameter group is a single frame parameter group that provides Course Over 
Ground (COG) and Speed Over Ground(SOG).

129029 : This parameter group conveys a comprehensive set of Global Navigation Satellite 
System (GNSS) parameters, including position information.

129033 : This parameter group has a single transmission that provides: UTC time, UTC Date and 
Local Offset Datum Local geodetic,datum and datum offsets from a reference datum.

129539 : This PGN provides a single transmission containing GNSS status and dilution of 
precision components (DOP) that indicate the contribution of satellite geometry to the 
overall positioning error. There are three DOP parameters reported, horizontal (HDOP),
Vertical (VDOP) and time (TDOP).

129540 : GNSS information on current satellites in view tagged by sequence ID. 
Information includes PRN, elevation, azimuth, SNR, defines the number of satellites; 
defines the satellite number and the information.

130306 : Direction and speed of Wind. True wind can be referenced to the vessel or to the 
ground. The Apparent Wind is what is felt standing on the (moving) ship, I.e., 
the wind measured by the typical mast head instruments. The boat referenced true wind is
given by the vector sum of Apparent wind and vessel's heading and speed though the water. 
The ground referenced true wind is given by the vector sum of Apparent wind and vessel's 
heading and speed over ground. : OK

130311 : This PGN has been depricated. Specific PGNs 130316 Temperature, 
130313 Relative Humidity, 130314 Actual Pressure,
130315 Set Pressure shall be used.
130314 : Pressure as measured by a specific pressure source
130845 : Simnet uses PGN 130845 for backlight control.
262161 : Proprietary Actisense:
